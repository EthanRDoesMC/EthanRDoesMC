### Hey, I'm Ethan.

**I'm a computer science student** entering my junior year this fall.

Right now my current "thing" is No Man's Sky Retro, a community around the older "classic" No Man's Sky versions.

I'm also learning vim motions!


### Bio
I've always been interested in making things on a computer, and in 2017 I stepped over the threshold into programming. I was self-taught and I made *very little progress* until early 2020. (Click on the Dawn repository to see that!)

I have a bit of a raw talent for reverse engineering that I've been turning into a skillset over the years. In early 2021 Beeper commissioned me to **research and build an iMessage client**/Matrix bridge, which I called Brooklyn. It's not what they use today, but it provided a lot of the foundational research. (That's quite the accomplishment for someone who learned what a return type was a year prior!)

In late 2021, a bit overwhelmed with depression and attending a college I couldn't really afford nor wanted to attend, I resorted to hobbyist development to keep myself afloat. KBPulse and TouchBarFun are the result. 

I am now attending a state university. It's a lot cheaper and I'm a lot happier with the program and the university. As a result I've had less time for completely original, massive projects -- because I am actually doing my schoolwork now lol -- but I keep myself involved in whatever interests me.
